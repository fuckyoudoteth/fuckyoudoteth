<h1>Fuck You Dot Eth</h1>

<h3>A daily auction and dividend-paying coin</h3>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>We propose a means of monetizing societal rage; a daily, recurring auction
allowing participants to voice their angry opinions.
A simple, ascending-price auction is held daily, and the winner is given
a platform to broadcast a message of their choosing via a high-profile
channel. Proceeds from the auction are paid out to coin-holders
as a daily dividend.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Marshall McLuhan once postulated that "all forms of violence are quests for
identity".
When we, as humans, feel our identities threatened,
we instinctually lash out to reassert our sense of selves.</p>

<p>In modern times, the means of asserting our agency has branched out from
mainly physical forms of demonstration, to mainly the realm of the verbal.
Not only is it more resource efficient to use verbal communication to
assert ourselves, its often more effective.</p>

<p>In the social media era, everyone has been given an online presence.
The proliferation of content-generation tools has, on one hand,
made it easier than ever to send messages out with a global reach.
Unfortunately, its also resulted in a sea of content that makes it
nearly impossible to have messages actually heard over the cacophony of voices.
There is simply too much noise in proportion to any one person's signal.</p>

<p>What is left is a burning desire for individuals to be heard, <strong>on a high-profile channel</strong>.
And in our global village, where opinions naturally differ
and abrasive situations present themselves,
people desire a platform to say.... fuck you.</p>

<h2>Overview of FuckYouDotEth</h2>

<p>The FuckYou network is centered around a daily auction for exclusive digital
real estate. Participants bid for access to the FuckYou.eth homepage and
associated message distribution channels. We expect FuckYou.eth to become the
frontpage fuck-you of the internet.</p>

<p>All collected ether proceeds from the auction process are paid into a
beneficiary account. The beneficiary, the FuckYouCoin contract, can withdraw all
beneficiary funds into its own account.
The coin contract, in turn, divvies out all funds sent to it to the coinholders.</p>

<h2>Auction Details</h2>

<p>There are three main functions that users of the auction will use: <code>bid</code>,
<code>resetAuction</code>, and <code>withdraw</code>.</p>

<h4>Bidding</h4>

<p>When a participant creates a bid, all elements of the bid are required upfront,
including their message to publish, with all elements being encoded at
the time of bid, rather than at a later stage.
A <code>bid</code> in the FuckYouAuction consists of a <code>bidder</code>, <code>amount</code>,
<code>donationAddress</code>, and <code>message</code>.
The <code>bidder</code> is the address of the participant, the <code>amount</code> is the total number
of wei (the smallest denomination of ether) to bid, the <code>donationAddress</code> is an Ethereum address to be published upon
winning the auction, the <code>message</code> is, at the UI level, a 128 byte length UTF-8
string, at the contract level, 4 32 byte UTF-8 strings to also be published upon
winning the auction.</p>

<h4>Ending the Auction</h4>

<p>When the auction time has expired, the auction becomes open for reset.
The auction then requires an explicit <code>resetAuction</code> call or a new <code>bid</code>.
In this case, the <code>bid</code> call will perform an implicit <code>resetAuction</code>.</p>

<h4>Withdrawing Losing Bids</h4>

<p>Whenever an auction participant is outbid with a higher amount, the participant
is able to retrieve 99% of their losing bid through a <code>withdraw</code> call. The 1%
remaining is added to the beneficiary fund.</p>

<h2>Roadmap Features</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Historical Auction View</strong> - A way to easily access previous auction results
through the FuckYou website. This view will make winning auctions much more
valuable, as participants' messages will be accessible and enshrined on the site
forever.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Twitter Bot</strong> - A public Twitter account tweeting all action from the
FuckYou network, as well as software to run your own bot. This will allow
participants' messages to reach a much wider audience through a means-tested
platform. Having public bot software also allows messages to continue to be
broadcast even in the event of Twitter censorship against the official
FuckYouDotEth account.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Public API</strong> - A public REST API to interact with the FuckYou network, as
well as software to run your own API service. A public API paves the way for
traditional webapps to access the FuckYou network without needing specialized
Ethereum software.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mobile Apps</strong> - Android and iOS apps to interact with the FuckYou network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tor Hidden Service</strong> - A publicly accessible Tor hidden service website for
accessing the FuckYou API and website. This opens the doors for use of the
FuckYou network for whistleblower and leaker applications. Any users desiring to
remain anonymous can use our Tor hidden service to do so.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Crowdfunding</h2>

<p>Since the project runs entirely on Ethereum, the token creation process will be
organized entirely by smart contracts on its network.
Participants willing to buy FuckYouCoins (FUCs) can do so by sending
ether to the designated address.
By doing so, they create FUCs at a rate of between 1200 to 800 FUCs per 1 ETH.</p>

<p>The crowdfunding will take place over the course of 30 days, starting after 2
weeks of the FuckYou network's operation.
Early ICO participants will receive 1200 FUCs per 1 ETH for the first ~5 days
(where a day = 4800 blocks) of the crowdsale, and for the next 25 days, the rate
will drop by 16 FUC/ETH daily until it reaches 800 FUC/ETH for the final day of
the ICO.</p>
